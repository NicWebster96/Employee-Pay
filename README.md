# CPSC 301 Section 1, Spring 2019

## Nicholas Webster

### Project 2
Similar to project 1, project 2 uses an array of employees. However, a class is used rather than a struct.


### Project 4
Project 2 is edited to use vectors rather than arrays and methods are used rather than creating a temporary object in the functions. The object is built directly into the emplace_back method.
